# sample_finder
## Getting Started
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/jake-drysdale/sample_finder/releases), unzip the folder and run the executable.

## Usage
- Pick a folder with your audio library in it, this could be something like a folder you keep all your sample packs in or a folder where you download all your tracks and albums to. 

- Then click analyze and the tool will extract information about your tracks and store them in a db (UserLibrary/embeddings/embeddings.npy)

- Once the analysis is complete you can search for a track by typing in the search bar and clicking search. The tool will then find the most similar tracks to the one you searched for and display them in the UI and save a playlist file in the UserLibrary/playlists folder.
